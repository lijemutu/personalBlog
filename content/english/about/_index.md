I am a software engineer with a background in physics (BSc). This space hosts my technical essays, business ideas I'm exploring, and progress updates on personal projects I build. I write to make my thinking public, attract collaborators and clients, and document lessons learned.

If you'd like to work together or discuss an idea, use the contact page or find me on GitHub and LinkedIn.
