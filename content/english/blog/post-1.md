This is a starter note I keep for new projects. It lists the quick steps I follow to move an idea from concept to a minimal, testable product.

1. Define the problem and success metric.
2. Draft a 1-page plan and the smallest possible UX to validate the idea.
3. Build a minimal prototype using a familiar stack (fast iteration over perfect architecture).
4. Deploy quickly to a public URL, measure behavior, and iterate.

Notes:
- Keep the scope small. 1–2 core flows are enough for the first test.
- Automate the build and deployment (CI/CD) to reduce friction.
- Track a single metric that matters (signup rate, click-to-conversion, engagement).

I use this site to document experiments and keep a public history of projects I share with collaborators and potential customers.
