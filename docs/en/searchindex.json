These sites are built with a framework and the content is based on templates with markdown (.md) files, which offer great flexibility for creating written content (titles, subtitles, lists, images, etc.).\nIn previous projects, I found the simplicity of generating HTML files appealing, as no service or hosting is required.\nDeveloper Experience By setting up the local environment (project and scripts) and GitHub Pages (just 2 clicks), the development process stops and content creation begins.\nLocal Environment Install Hugo and its dependencies (Windows 11 in my case) Create a project with hugo new site \u0026lt;site-name\u0026gt; and initialize version control with git init Find an official theme and add it as a submodule Customize the site to your liking GitHub Pages When you publish your project on GitHub and have your repository public, you can find the Pages menu in the settings section. By selecting the folder where the compiled project is located, GitHub generates a public URL that is accessible.\nContent Creation Create a new .md file in the \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; folder, build the site, and commit your changes. The process starts automatically, and within a few minutes, your content is available at the public URL.\n"}]
