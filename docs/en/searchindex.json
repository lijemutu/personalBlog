It lists the quick steps I follow to move an idea from concept to a minimal, testable product.\nDefine the problem and success metric. Draft a 1-page plan and the smallest possible UX to validate the idea. Build a minimal prototype using a familiar stack (fast iteration over perfect architecture). Deploy quickly to a public URL, measure behavior, and iterate. Notes:\nKeep the scope small. 1–2 core flows are enough for the first test. Automate the build and deployment (CI/CD) to reduce friction. Track a single metric that matters (signup rate, click-to-conversion, engagement). I use this site to document experiments and keep a public history of projects I share with collaborators and potential customers.\n"}]
